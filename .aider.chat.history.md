Description:
Layer-2 Fee Tracker helps crypto users save money and time by providing real-time insights into transaction fees across popular Layer-2 networks. Compare costs, optimize your transactions, and avoid overpaying on gas.

Key Features:
 • Real-time monitoring of transaction fees on major Layer-2 solutions (Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync, etc.).
 • Historical fee charts to identify trends and optimal transaction times.
 • Alerts for fee spikes or drops.
 • Quick comparison between Layer-2 networks and Ethereum mainnet fees.
 • User-friendly interface for both casual users and active traders.

Target Users:
Crypto users, traders, and developers looking to reduce transaction costs and optimize Layer-2 usage.

Usage Instructions:
 1. Select the Layer-2 network(s) you want to monitor.
 2. View real-time fee data and historical trends.
 3. Set alerts for fee thresholds or significant changes.
 4. Plan transactions when fees are lowest to save on gas costs.

Benefits:
 • Reduce transaction costs by timing your operations effectively.
 • Stay informed about Layer-2 network conditions in real-time.
 • Compare fees across multiple networks for smarter decision-making.

Please add the file `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can edit the title and description. Once that file is added, I’ll also create a new `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` file for the app logo.
